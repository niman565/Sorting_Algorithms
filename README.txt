PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!

In order to compile the source files, simply type in "make" and the files, "start2.h" and "start2.cpp" and "sort.h" and "sort.cpp", 
should compile. "start2.h.gch" is just a compressed version of "start2.h"
that the GNU Compiler produces to compile more quickly, so do not modify or delete it.

When the files have been compiled, type in "./Student" to run the program. 
When you are finished with the program, type in "make clean" to delete all executable files.
